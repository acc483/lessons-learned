Summary learnt from how to communicate with developers. Engineering people have different set of views with people from business world. Most business leaders excel at communicating their business vision, but they may fail to communicate with software engineers to explain the details of what they are seeking.After the Digital literacy class, I have a general sense of how to demonstrate my ideas to the professional developers.There are several very efficient way to show our ideas. First of all, using pen and paper to sketch specific parts of the user interface and talk to the developers to identify best solution. We also need to indentify the user flow to show how the user naviate through different sections. Second, we can use business case.The thinking flow might be what is the problem, what do we need to achive and then what is the solution. Figuring out every detail you want to adress, the developers will have a clear understanding what your thoughts.
