This is a summary of questions to ask when hiring programmers.

What are your passions?  What type of work environment do you enjoy?  Can you please send me references, both from a client, or someone non-technical, and from a past technical manager?  Do you have a Github profile?  Have you worked on a similar project in the past that we can leverage?  What is your opinion on how we should design this part of the site?  How strongly do you feel about this?

These questions can help avoid the below from happening

It is key to understand if the developer has the urge to learn new frameworks and languages. So it would be good to ask the developer to name the framework that he used and how he compare this to the others. I would also ask what programing language the developer is apt in and how he compare this to the others. This can show that the developer is eager to learn and are willing to invest his time to follow the trend in technology. On the same note, it will be good to ask if the developer like the “story” based or “motivation” based software development technique to make sure he has ample experience in developing a large project.
